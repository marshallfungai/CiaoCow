React Native Assessment
Ever felt hungry but had no clue what to eat? Well thanks to CiaoChow this will never happen again.

We'd like you to build the CiaoChow mobile experience using Expo. The design team has been hard at work prepping this Figma file for you to follow => https://www.figma.com/file/bscWZpaWT1Leu0BGBWK0NV/CiaoChow?node-id=19%3A518. You'll be able to grab all assets and see all styling there.

The user journey is simple:
Review the onboarding splash screen
Register an account
Login
Be presented with something to eat
Don't like the option, just click "Nah" to be given another choice (randomise).
The API is all set up for you already at https://ciaochow.plusnarrative.biz/ and we've included the Postman Collection which will show you the endpoints and payloads to use. You'll need to grab the JWT token returned after login so you can pass it as a bearer token when requesting "chow" ideas.
The client is pretty tech savvy, so when you're done, please just zip the project folder (you can exclude the node_modules) and ship it to us.
They also know you're under pressure with previous commitments and are wanting you to give them a realistic timeline.

Good luck, and please reach out if you have any questions.
